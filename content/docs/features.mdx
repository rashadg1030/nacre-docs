What makes Nacre different.

## Type-Safe Routes

Define your API shape once. The compiler ensures your handlers match.

```haskell
route = input :-> output

-- Handler must return the correct type
action = route := handler
```

## Composable Building Blocks

Build complex APIs from simple, reusable pieces.

```haskell
-- Reusable authentication
withAuth = request & header @Token "Authorization"

-- Compose into routes
protectedInput = withAuth & method GET & path (lit "profile")
```

## Clear Error Messages

Value-level DSL means readable errors, not type-level puzzles.

## Fast Compile Times

No heavy type-level machinery. Your feedback loop stays tight.

## Layered Architecture

Each layer has a single responsibility:

| Layer | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Request | What comes in |
| Response | What goes out |
| Route | Connect request to response |
| Action | Bind handler to route |
| Server | Combine actions |

## Middleware Support

Add cross-cutting concerns without boilerplate.

```haskell
withLogging = middleware $ \req next -> do
  log req
  next req
```

## Client Generation

Generate type-safe clients for your frontend.

```haskell
-- Coming soon
```
