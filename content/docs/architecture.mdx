title: Architecture
---

A deep dive into Nacre's internal architecture for advanced users and contributors.

## Core Design

Nacre is built on a layered architecture:

1. **DSL Layer** - The user-facing combinators for building APIs
2. **Type Layer** - Compile-time type checking and inference
3. **Runtime Layer** - Request parsing, routing, and response generation
4. **WAI Layer** - Integration with the Haskell web application interface

## Type System

Nacre leverages GHC's type system to provide compile-time guarantees about API correctness.

## Extensibility

The framework is designed to be extended through:

- Custom middleware
- Type-safe plugins
- WAI integration
