title: vs Servant
---

Nacre and Servant are both type-safe Haskell web frameworks, but they take different approaches.

## API Definition

**Servant** uses type-level API definitions:

```haskell
type API = "users" :> Capture "id" Int :> Get '[JSON] User
```

**Nacre** uses a value-level DSL:

```haskell
input = request
  & method GET
  & path (lit "users" *> capture @Int "id")

output = response
  & status 200
  & body @User

route = input :-> output
```

## Trade-offs

| Aspect | Nacre | Servant |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Error messages | Clear, value-level | Complex, type-level |
| Compile times | Faster | Slower |
| IDE support | Better | Limited |
| Flexibility | High | Moderate |
| Ecosystem | New | Mature |

## When to Choose Nacre

- You want readable error messages
- Compile times matter to your workflow
- You prefer explicit, composable building blocks

## When to Choose Servant

- You need the mature ecosystem and community
- You're already invested in Servant's patterns
- You want client generation from types
