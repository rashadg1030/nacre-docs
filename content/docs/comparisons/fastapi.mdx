title: vs FastAPI
---

Nacre and FastAPI target different languages but share a focus on developer experience and type safety.

## API Definition

**FastAPI** uses Python decorators with type hints:

```python
@app.get("/users/{user_id}")
def get_user(user_id: int) -> User:
    return find_user(user_id)
```

**Nacre** uses a Haskell DSL:

```haskell
input = request
  & method GET
  & path (lit "users" *> capture @Int "id")

output = response
  & status 200
  & body @User

action = (input :-> output) := \Input{..} ->
  findUser pathData
```

## Trade-offs

| Aspect | Nacre | FastAPI |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Type checking | Compile-time | Runtime |
| Performance | Native compiled | Async Python |
| Ecosystem | Haskell libraries | Python ecosystem |
| Learning curve | Steeper | Gentler |
| Refactoring safety | Excellent | Good |

## When to Choose Nacre

- You need compile-time guarantees
- Performance is critical
- You're building in a Haskell stack

## When to Choose FastAPI

- Your team knows Python
- You need the Python ecosystem
- Rapid prototyping is the priority
