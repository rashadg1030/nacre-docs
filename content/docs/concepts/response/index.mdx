title: Overview

A response describes the shape of an HTTP response. Like request, each aspect has its own DSL.

```haskell
output
  = response
  & status 200
  & headers none
  & body @Text
```

## Response Choice

When an endpoint can return different responses:

```haskell
ok = response
  & status 200
  & body @User

notFound = response
  & status 404
  & body @ErrorMessage

outputs = either notFound ok
```
