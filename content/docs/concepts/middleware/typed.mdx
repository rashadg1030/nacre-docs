title: Typed Middleware
---

Typed middleware integrates with the contract system, providing compile-time guarantees about request and response transformations.

```haskell
modifyReq = ...

modifyResps = ...

modifyHandler = ...

middleware = modifyReq @-> modifyResps @= modifyHandler
```

## Applying to a Single Endpoint

```haskell
endpoint = someReq :-> someResps := someHandler

newEndpoint = middleware endpoint
```

## Applying to Multiple Endpoints

```haskell
newServer = middleware Server.do
  endpoint1
  endpoint2
  endpoint3
```
