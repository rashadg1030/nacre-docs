title: WAI Middleware
---

Nacre can integrate with standard WAI middleware for compatibility with the broader Haskell ecosystem.

WAI (Web Application Interface) is the standard interface for Haskell web applications. Any existing WAI middleware can be used with Nacre.

```haskell
-- Example: Using WAI middleware
import Network.Wai.Middleware.RequestLogger (logStdoutDev)

app = logStdoutDev $ toApplication server
```
