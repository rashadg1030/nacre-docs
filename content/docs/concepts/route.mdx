title: Route
---

Routes associate a request with its possible responses. They define the complete API specification for an endpoint.

```haskell
-- Associate input with outputs
route = input :-> outputs
```

The `:->` operator creates a route from a request and response specification. This route can then be used to:

- Generate API documentation
- Create type-safe handlers
- Derive client code
